/**
 * How a fusion opens, once and never looped, over its first {@link FusionTiming.intro} seconds. Its moments are choreographed in seconds of a {@link choreographed}-second intro and stretch with the timing’s.
 *
 * A singularity tears open in front of the work and sucks at everything around it: a wide stretch of the room bends toward it, twisting like water down a drain and darkening, while the work is torn from its wall and what was thrown into it is dragged along. Full, it collapses and bursts, the room snaps back like jelly and the burst knocks everything loose into the air.
 * The light it flung out streams back in and kindles an ember, which beats like a heart: each beat yanks an ingredient into place beside the ember, the work first, each surfacing in the ember as it arrives, and a last beat ignites the ember into the portal and sets them circling it.
 * At that, the portal lashes a tether out to each and whirls them around itself like a hammer thrower, ever faster and a little pulled in, until the comet trails of fire they leave behind close into a ring around it while the room swirls along. At full speed it lets go: they coast on out into their orbit, two laps further along, while the ring of fire falls into the portal and lands just as the intro ends with a blaze, a shockwave and a burst of sparks, the room rippling out from it.
 *
 * It keeps the {@link pulse} of the whole fusion, three of them long: the burst falls on the first, the ignition on the second and the landing on the third, after which the images take their turns on it. The ember’s beats divide the pulse between the burst and the ignition evenly, one for each ingredient: a triplet for two, sixteenths for three, a quintuplet for four.
 *
 * The portal’s envelope, the satellites’ orbit and the fusion’s sound play their parts of it; this module holds its moments and drives the warp, the motes, the tethers and the trails.
