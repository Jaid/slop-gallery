 * The body of the alchemy machine, see {@link machineBody}, in its own frame on the floor under its middle, its front toward the room, along −z: an iron chest on a plinth band with a lid band round its top, both riveted, a collar round the sink’s throat coming down into its lid, a flange where its pipe leaves its east side, four squat feet and a round window in its front behind a brass bezel.
 * The window’s `glass` is a disc of its own, which glows while the machine works on an orb.
