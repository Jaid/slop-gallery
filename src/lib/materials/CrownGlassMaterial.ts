 * A perfectly clean, flat pane reads as an empty opening. Real old glass gives itself away through its imperfections instead:
 * drawn ripples make the room behind it and the reflections on it wobble, a faint veil scatters light,
 * wiped streaks dull the shine in patches and grime settles along the frame.
