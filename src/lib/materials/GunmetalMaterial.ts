/**
 * Cast gunmetal, like an antique crystal ball stand: dark, slightly bluish gray metal, rubbed brighter in places and dulled to near black in others, with the faint grain of its casting.
 *
 * Wholly metal, without a diffuse color: lamps as yellow as the chandeliers’ candles would turn any diffuse gray olive. All it shows is its reflection, of a softly lit studio like the gold’s instead of the gallery’s dim, olive-tinted environment, dark gray but for the softboxes’ streaks and the glints of the lamps.
 * Its variation follows local meters, so it stays put on an instanced or carried object.
