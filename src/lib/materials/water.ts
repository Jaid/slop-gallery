 * The reflection environment shared by every piece of the Lobby fountain’s water.

 * A bright procedural sky instead of the gallery’s dim gradient is what lets the ripples and the falling sheets sparkle: their normals
 * swing across the sun’s disc and the bright crown of the vault. It belongs to the page, like the shared gold and steel environments,
 * so graphics-mode changes and remounts do not build it again.
