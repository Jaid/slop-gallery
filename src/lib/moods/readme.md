# Moods

A mood (`base/Mood.ts`) is a spell over the whole world while something casts it. It contributes any of three kinds of transformation, all optional, all fading in and out together at the mood’s strength:

| Kind | Members | Where it applies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color filters | `grade`, `lamps`, `fill` | `rendering/moodGrade.ts` lays the gradient map over the finished frame after `renderOutput`; `lightLevels.ts` multiplies every light’s color by the tint of its kind. |
| Ambience | `ambience` | A centered `AmbienceLoop` class, made anew each time the mood begins, on the effects master. |
| Sound transformer | `transformer` | A `SoundTransformer` in `SoundEngine.transformers`, which every sound of the world passes through, like a room’s `reverberation`. |

Two things cast moods, both asked for by `#component/Moods` every frame:

- The room the player is in, through its `moods` option (usually one `RoomMood`, made of options, with the room’s acoustics). Room moods come and go in 0.5 s both ways (`roomMoodFade`), so two rooms’ moods cross over evenly in a doorway, and a mood that both rooms name holds on.
- The mood cast over the world: `?mood`, otherwise the fusion’s while any portal is open, otherwise that of the prop held or viewed with V (an orb’s). These take turns: the next one fades in only once the last one is gone. They live in `index.ts`, which `?mood` picks from; room moods don’t.

`MoodMixer` stacks every mood showing, the room’s beneath the cast one, each at its own eased progress: gradient maps one over the other (four at most, the faintest left out beyond), light tints multiplied, loops summed and transformers chained (six links, see `src/lib/audio/readme.md`). N under `?development` cuts every mood at once, the rooms’ included, and brings the ones due back in full when lifted.
