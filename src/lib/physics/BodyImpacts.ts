 * The solver has already bounced the bodies by the time Rapier reports a collision, so their velocities then tell little; and a body rolling along a floor that is one collider with its walls never starts a new collision when it hits a wall.
 * Points that keep touching, like the corner of a work sliding down a wall while it spins, strike only once, and a work tipping over strikes with every corner it lands on. A body strikes at most once per {@link cooldown}, and two registered bodies striking each other count once.
