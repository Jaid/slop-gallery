 * A dropped image arriving as a work: a shimmer swells out of nothing for a third of a second and the canvas lands with a soft thump and a warm fifth, or, where it is `hung` right away, the shimmer swells until its hanging, which sounds for itself, slaps it onto its wall, where the fifth rings out.
 * `variation` (−1–1) tunes it a little apart, so works arriving one after another never sound alike. `swell` is how many seconds the shimmer swells before the work is there, a third of a second by default, as long as a hanging takes to strike its wall for a work slapped onto one.
