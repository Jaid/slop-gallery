 * Times the bundled portrait narrations letter by letter for their subtitles, with Meta’s MMS forced aligner (scripts/lib/mmsAlign.py, run through uv with its own CPU-only Torch), and writes src/worlds/gallery/narrationTimings.json: per artwork, the start and end of every character of the text it reads in one flat list, null for characters without a span. Word spans follow from them when the catalog loads.
 * Rerun it whenever a bundled narration or the title or description it reads changes; test/unit/narration-timings.test.ts notices stale entries.
