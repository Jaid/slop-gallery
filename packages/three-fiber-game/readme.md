# three-fiber-game

A small, composable game root for native WebGPU React Three Fiber apps. Bring your scene; opt into keyboard controls and Rapier physics; inject providers and dependent content with wrappers.

No gallery state, graphics-quality provider, telemetry, capture service or postprocessing dependency. The application owns those policies. This ESM package exports TypeScript source for modern Bun and bundler consumers, following the repository’s other workspace packages. It is not published yet.

## Usage

```tsx
import Game from 'three-fiber-game'
import {RigidBody} from '@react-three/rapier'

export default function App() {
  return <Game controls={{forward: ['KeyW', 'ArrowUp'], jump: 'Space'}} physics camera={{position: [0, 2, 5]}}>
    <ambientLight intensity={2}/>
    <RigidBody>
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry/>
        <meshStandardNodeMaterial color="orange"/>
      </mesh>
    </RigidBody>
  </Game>
}
```

The parent container must have a nonzero height. Canvas props such as `camera`, `dpr`, `shadows`, `frameloop`, `onCreated`, events, styles and the canvas `ref` pass through. DPR and shadow defaults come from Fiber, not a hidden quality preset. Physics and keyboard controls are absent unless requested.

## Wrappers

Like `mount-root`, each wrapper prop accepts a component or a readonly array of components. The first entry is outermost: `[A, B]` means `<A><B>{children}</B></A>`. Arrays are never mutated. Omitted wrappers and empty arrays are no-ops.

- `wrapper`: wraps Canvas, inside keyboard controls. Use it for DOM-side providers, boundaries or overlays. It cannot call Fiber scene hooks itself.
- `sceneWrapper`: wraps the world inside Canvas, outside Physics. Use it for scene providers, render effects, telemetry and capture bridges. Its components can call `useThree` and `useFrame` from `@react-three/fiber/webgpu`.

```tsx
import type {GameWrapperProps} from 'three-fiber-game'
import Game from 'three-fiber-game'

import CaptureBridge from './CaptureBridge.tsx'
import Postprocessing from './Postprocessing.tsx'
import Scene from './Scene.tsx'
import SettingsProvider from './SettingsProvider.tsx'
import TelemetryBridge from './TelemetryBridge.tsx'

function SceneIntegrations({children}: GameWrapperProps) {
  return <>
    <CaptureBridge/>
    <TelemetryBridge/>
    {children}
    <Postprocessing/>
  </>
}

export default function App() {
  return <Game wrapper={[SettingsProvider]} sceneWrapper={SceneIntegrations} physics>
    <Scene/>
  </Game>
}
```

The resulting hierarchy is:

```text
KeyboardControls (when controls has at least one action)
  wrapper[0] → wrapper[1] → …
    Canvas
      sceneWrapper[0] → sceneWrapper[1] → …
        Physics (when enabled)
          children
```

Wrappers receive `children` and must render them to retain the world. Put integrations requiring Rapier context directly around or beside your scene in `Game`’s children, not in `sceneWrapper`. DOM elements belong outside Canvas unless rendered through an appropriate portal.

Define wrapper components at module scope, not inline during render. Read changing settings from context inside stable wrappers. Keep wrapper types, order, physics enablement and keyboard-control presence stable to preserve the mounted scene. An inline wrapper function or a changed wrapper topology can remount its descendants. Changing normal Canvas props or context values does not introduce package-owned keys or reset the physics world. Renderer constructor options are not reactive; changing quality should adjust scene resources and Canvas budgets rather than reconstructing the renderer.

## Controls and physics

Omitting `controls` or passing `{}` or `[]` skips `KeyboardControls`. An action with an empty key list is still a declared action and retains its keyboard state.

`Controls<Actions>` accepts either a record of action names to a key string or readonly key array, or a readonly array of full Drei entries. Entries preserve options such as `up: false`. Normalization copies entries and key arrays, so Drei never receives caller-owned mutable data. `normalizeControls` is also exported for use outside `Game`.

```tsx
import type {Controls} from 'three-fiber-game'
import {useKeyboardControls} from '@react-three/drei/webgpu'

type Actions = 'forward' | 'jump'
const controls = {
  forward: ['KeyW', 'ArrowUp'],
  jump: 'Space',
} as const satisfies Controls<Actions>

function Player() {
  const jumping = useKeyboardControls<Actions>(state => state.jump)
  // Use the selected action in your player logic.
  return null
}
```

`physics` defaults to `false`. `true` enables Rapier with gravity `[0, -9.81, 0]`. An options object passes through all `PhysicsProps` except `children`, including `paused`, `timeStep`, `colliders` and `debug`. An empty object enables physics with Rapier’s defaults. Keep your normal Suspense and error boundaries above the game; physics can suspend while loading WASM.

## Renderer

The exported `WebgpuRenderer` class constructs Three’s `WebGPUBackend` directly. Adapter/device initialization errors propagate; there is no fallback renderer. Game’s default factory sets `alpha: false` and `antialias: false`, leaving postprocessing and antialiasing policy to the application.

To configure a native renderer, pass a stable `GameRenderer` factory. Fiber owns initialization and the renderer lifecycle. Factories may also return a promise.

```tsx
import type {GameRenderer} from 'three-fiber-game'
import Game, {WebgpuRenderer} from 'three-fiber-game'

const renderer: GameRenderer = options => new WebgpuRenderer({...options, antialias: true})

export default function App() {
  return <Game renderer={renderer}/>
}
```

`WebgpuRendererOptions` excludes compatibility switches. Legacy `gl` and `flat` Canvas props are not exposed. Browser rendering requires native WebGPU in a secure context.

## Peer dependencies and bundler setup

Use the peer versions in `package.json`: React 19, Three r186, Fiber 10’s WebGPU entry, Drei 11’s WebGPU entry and Rapier 2.2. All are peer dependencies, including Rapier when physics is disabled, because the package statically imports its component.

Rapier 2.2 still declares Fiber 9 peers and imports bare `@react-three/fiber`. The host must resolve those imports to the same WebGPU Fiber module as Canvas. Slop Gallery uses this Vite alias:

```ts
resolve: {
  alias: [{find: /^@react-three\/fiber$/u, replacement: '@react-three/fiber/webgpu'}],
}
```

Do not install or bundle separate Fiber copies for Rapier. Use WebGPU entry points in application code too. This is an explicit integration requirement for the current prerelease engine combination, not an automatic compatibility layer hidden in the package.

## Exports and checks

- `Game` (also the default export), `normalizeControls` and `WebgpuRenderer`.
- Types: `GameProps`, `GamePhysicsProps`, `GameRenderer`, `Controls`, `ControlBinding`, `GameWrapperProps`, `GameWrapper`, `GameWrappers` and `WebgpuRendererOptions`.

Run `bun test` in this package. Tests cover composition, wrapper ordering and context injection, readonly controls, physics options, renderer defaults and native initialization failure. These are structural/server-rendered tests, not a GPU playtest. The test preload matches Vite’s ESM preference for Rapier and aliases its bare Fiber import to the shared WebGPU entry. This avoids Bun’s CommonJS loading path attempting to require Three’s async module.

The repository’s `bun run check:package` also packs the package and tests, typechecks and bundles it in an isolated consumer without workspace path aliases. That consumer uses the same explicit WebGPU dependency resolution as the app.
